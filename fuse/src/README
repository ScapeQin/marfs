Starting to keep some notes here, for others that want to pick up development.

(1) building


The makefile is currently a big "bag of tricks" to help me with debugging
and running.  There are several environment-vars that are important:

    USE_SYSLOG  -- if defined (regardless of value), compile so that all log
                   messages are sent to syslog.  You have to be root for
                   this to work.  You also have to have the syslog daemon
                   running.

    DEBUG       -- If defined to non-zero, compilations are done with '-g',
                   and mounts run in the foreground (no threads).
                   If defined > 1, then any debugging output will also include
                   low-level curl conversations with the server.

    USE_SPROXYD -- If defined, then failure to find ~/.awsAuth is not
                   considered fatal.  This is something of a kludge, if
                   you try to use S3 without ~/.awsAuth, your requests can't
                   succeed.  Some of the hardwired repos support S3.  But maybe
                   you know that you aren't going to use those.

If you make

If you don't define DEBUG or SYSLOG, there will be no log messages.
If you don't run fuse in the background, then print statements go nowhere.

So, here are some tricks I use for debugging:

   # run in foreground, compiled so I can intervene with gdb
   make clean
   make DEBUG=2


    # *** I am often wanting to "unmount fuse; then remove all objects,
    # MDFS files, trash, and log-output; then rebuild; then re-mount".
    # That can be done easily as follows:

    make clean
    make redo2 DEBUG=2


   # re-build to use scality:

   make clean
   make DEBUG=2 TRY_CONFIG=1
   make redo2 DEBUG=2



(2) debugging

You can attach gdb to a running fuse client.

    make gdb

(You'll want to be sure marfs_fuse was compiled with DEBUG=something.  See
above.)  Then set break-points, and continue.  Then run a program or
command that will invoke that break-point (e.g. 'echo "testing" >
/marfs/test00/myfile')

NOTE: after the first continue, you can't get control back in gdb, unless a
break-point is hit.  Then you can detach by quitting.


You can always mount fusectl, then abort all stuck operations by catting
into the 'abort' files in the fusectl mount.

    make abort
