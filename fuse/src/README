Starting to keep some notes here, for others that want to pick up development.

(1) building

The makefile is currently a big "bag of tricks" to help me with debugging
and running.  there are two environment-vars that are important:

    USE_SYSLOG -- if defined (regardless of value), compile so that all log
                  messages are sent to syslog.  You have to be root for
                  this to work.  You also have to have the syslog daemon
                  running.

    DEBUG -- if undef, or defined empty, or defined 0, run fuse in the background
             if undef or defined empty, compile with debugging-flags (else optimize).
             if defined > 1, debugging output will include low-level curl conversation
             with the server.

    TRY_SPROXYD -- If defined, then the hardwired config uses our Scality
                   sproxyd-based repository.  Otherwise, our config repo is
                   based on EMC S3.

If you don't define DEBUG or SYSLOG, there will be no log messages.
If you don't run fuse in the background, then print statements go nowhere.

So, here are some tricks I use for debugging:

   # run in foreground, compiled so I can intervene with gdb
   make clean
   make DEBUG=2


    # *** I am often wanting to "unmount fuse; then remove all objects,
    # MDFS files, trash, and log-output; then rebuild; then re-mount".
    # That can be done easily as follows:

    make clean
    make redo2 DEBUG=2


   # re-build to use scality:

   make clean
   make DEBUG=2 TRY_CONFIG=1
   make redo2 DEBUG=2



(2) debugging

You can attach gdb to a running fuse client.

    make gdb

(You'll want to be sure marfs_fuse was compiled with DEBUG=something.  See
above.)  Then set break-points, and continue.  Then run a program or
command that will invoke that break-point (e.g. 'echo "testing" >
/marfs/test00/myfile')

NOTE: after the first continue, you can't get control back in gdb, unless a
break-point is hit.  Then you can detach by quitting.


You can always mount fusectl, then abort all stuck operations by catting
into the 'abort' files in the fusectl mount.

    make abort
