This script is used to scan the gpfs filesystem to determine total size by fileset of the of gpfs filesystem side of marFS.  The basis for this script is calls to the GPFS API to perform a scan of inodes.  


Usage:
./marfs_quota -d gpfs_mount_path -o output_filename [-c fileset_scan_count] [-i fileset_scan_index] 

-c fileset_scan_count
count on how many filesets to characterize

-d gpfs_mount_point

-i fileset_scan_index
where to start in the list of filesets (used with -c argument)
This is a way to reduce the 



-o fileinfo_filename
output filename with size info on filesets

-h

Future work includes doing quotas by user which could be implemented using a binary tree based on uid.
